# Object-Oriented Programming

## Learning Goals

- Discuss what Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Since the dawn of computers, how we program and write code has drastically changed. From FORTRAN to structured languages
to now object-oriented programming.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a model that is dependent upon the use of
classes, objects, methods, and attributes. We will learn more about classes and objects in a later unit. But for now
know that it focuses on those concepts rather than the logic. This means that the program is organized around the data
points and what is being affected rather than the functionality. This approach makes it easier to manipulate the data,
make modifications, and reuse code. These advantages that are built into languages like Java are what make OOP one of
the most popular programming paradigms.
